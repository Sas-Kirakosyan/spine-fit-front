## How It Works: Behind the Scenes

### 1. Split Scheduler (`splitScheduler.ts`)

```
Input: "Push/Pull/Legs" + 3 days/week
↓
Output:
- Day 1 (Monday): ["chest", "front_delts", "triceps"]
- Day 2 (Wednesday): ["lats", "upper_back", "rear_delts", "biceps"]
- Day 3 (Friday): ["quadriceps", "glutes", "hamstrings"]
```

### 2. Exercise Filter (`exerciseFilter.ts`)

```
Available exercises: 10 (from allExercise.json)
↓
Filter by:
  ✓ Equipment available
  ✓ Pain profile (if L5-S1 pain, avoid high-restriction exercises)
  ✓ Experience level (Intermediate → allow intermediate exercises)
  ✓ Back safety (only back-friendly exercises)
↓
Safe exercises: ~7-8 exercises
```

### 3. Volume Calculator (`volumeCalculator.ts`)

```
Duration: 45 min
Experience: Intermediate
↓
Calculate:
- Total sets per workout: ~12 sets
- Sets per exercise: 3 sets
- Reps per set: 10-12 reps
- Exercises per workout: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 exercises
↓
Result: 4 exercises × 3 sets = 12 total sets per workout
```

### 4. Exercise Assignment

```
For PUSH day:
- Need exercises that target: chest, front_delts, triceps
- Filter available exercises by muscle groups
- Select best 4 compound + isolation exercises
- Assign 3 sets × 10 reps to each

For PULL day:
- Need exercises that target: lats, upper_back, rear_delts, biceps
- Repeat process

For LEGS day:
- Need exercises that target: quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings
- Repeat process
```

### 5. Progressive Overload (`progressiveOverload.ts`)

```
IF user has workout history:
  - Load last performed weights for each exercise
  - Check consistency (gap between workouts)

  IF consistent (< 7 days gap):
    ✓ Increase weight by 2.5kg OR add 1-2 reps

  IF missed > 7 days:
    ⚠️ Decrease weight by 5-10% for safety

ELSE (first time):
  - Use default weights from exercise database
```
